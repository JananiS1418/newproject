            <p>
                When I was studying in 11th standard, it started as a small health problem. But when I entered 12th, my
                health condition became worse, and I couldn't attend school regularly. Because of that, I had to
                discontinue my 12th.With the support of my family and my own fighting spirit, I decided to continue my
                studies the next year. It was during the corona batch — most students were passed directly, but in my
                case, they said I had to write the exams because my hall ticket was already issued the previous year.
                At that time, I was really struggling with my health. I didn't know what to do, and it was very
                difficult for me. But my family kept encouraging me, saying, “You can do it, if you don't write these
                exams your life will be wasted.” Their support gave me strength.So, I prepared for each exam overnight
                and went to write it the next day.<b> Finally, all my efforts paid off, and I got my results successfully.</b>
                Because the counseling seats were full, I took an IT seat through management quota. During my 1st and 
                2nd years I did fairly well — though the health problems persisted,I managed to cope and continue.But
                in my 3rd year things became much worse. I began having severe episodes and my strength became very weak. 
                When I first had an episode, my family and friends were all very scared. We went to the hospital
                and the doctors told me there was a problem in my brain — they said something like “10% problem.” They
                started me on tablets, but the medication didn't fully help; it became more like a 20% problem. I went
                through many treatments and medicines, but nothing fixed it completely. Some days I would have episodes
                four or five times, and I couldn't fully recover each time. My family suffered a lot because of this,
                and I felt so helpless that at times I even thought about ending my life. I had terrible pain in my
                hands, legs, and head — I couldn't move freely.Then there was a turning point.<i><b> The doctors warned that
                if it kept getting worse, I could go into a coma.</b></i>The allopathic medicines didn't suit me and caused many
                side effects. After that, I decided to try Siddha medicine. <u>Gradually, with the Siddha treatment, I 
                started to improve and the condition came under control.</u> Within five months I was almost completely cured. 
                I truly believe that without my family's support and my determination, I would not have recovered.
