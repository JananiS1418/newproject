        <h2>What is JS?</h2>
        <P>JavaScript (JS) is a scripting language used to make web pages interactive, dynamic, and functional.
          It runs directly inside the web browser.</P>
        <h2>Why we use JS?</h2>
        <P>We use JavaScript to make webpages interactive and dynamic. It allows us to add animations, validate forms, update content without reloading, and respond to user actions like clicks or typing. While HTML builds the structure and CSS adds style, JavaScript controls the behavior, making websites more engaging and functional.</P>
        <h2>When we use JS ?</h2>
        <P>It is used to perform actions when users click buttons, fill forms, move the mouse, or type on the keyboard. JavaScript is also used to validate forms, update content without reloading, create animations, connect to servers, and control HTML and CSS</P>
        <h2>Where we use JS ?</h2>
        <P>We use JavaScript in many areas such as websites, web applications, mobile apps, and even servers. On websites, it is used to add interactivity and dynamic features. In web applications, JavaScript helps handle data and user actions in real time. Itâ€™s also used in mobile app development through frameworks like React Native, and on the server side using Node.js.</P>
        <h2>If using JS what is happening on the webpage?</h2>
        <p>When we use JavaScript, the webpage becomes dynamic and interactive. Users can click, type, or drag elements, and the page responds instantly without reloading. It allows animations, sliders, dropdowns, and pop-ups to work smoothly. JavaScript also helps validate and submit forms smartly, making the website more user-friendly and responsive.</p>
        <h2>Any other frontend Programming languages like JS?</h2>
        <p>TypeScript - Superset of JS with static types; compiles to JS, safer and easier for large apps.
            Dart-Used with Flutter; can compile to JavaScript for web apps.
            CoffeeScript - A simpler syntax that compiles into JavaScript.
            Elm -Functional language that compiles to JS, used for reliable web interfaces.
            ClojureScript-Clojure language that compiles to JS, supports functional programming.
            Reason / ReScript-Strongly typed languages that compile to JS, often used with React.</p>
        <h2>Types of Using JS</h2>
        <p> 1.Inline JavaScript - Written directly inside an HTML tag using the onclick, onchange, etc.
            <br>
            2.Internal JavaScript - Written inside the script tag within the html file
            <br>
            3.External JavaScript - Written in a separate .js file and linked to the HTML file
